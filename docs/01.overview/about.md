# About Pochoir

This plugin started from the frustration of not finding the right plugin for me or spending more time writing code with [Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/introduction.html) instead of creating template and start note-taking.

I liked the simplicity of the core **Template plugin**:
- No coding skill required
- Properties are merged automatically
- Place variables wherever you want

But it is too limited.

With **Pochoir**, we want to offer an easy and powerful user experience in template creation with small **yaml** and **javascript** code blocks.

We took inspiration from amazing works done on:
- [Silverbullet's space-lua](https://silverbullet.md/Space%20Lua)
- [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)
- [Varinote](https://github.com/gsarig/obsidian-varinote)
- [Modal Form](https://github.com/danielo515/obsidian-modal-form)
