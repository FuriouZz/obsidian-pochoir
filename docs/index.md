# Pochoir

Pochoir is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin for note templating.

With simplicity in mind, we want note templating made easy, with few configurations and no coding experience.

Most plugin features are provided by some [special properties](/special-properties/overview).

**Features**

- Use [poichoir-properties](/props/overview) code block as an alternative frontmatter
- Use powerful [properties](/special-properties/overview) for file renaming, property merging, function imports, template aliases and more
- Enhance your template generation with [modal form](/form/overview)
- [Trigger](/command/overview) your template from command palette or ribbon actions
- Use [Javascript](/javascript/overview) for more advanced usage
- Powered by [vento.js](https://vento.js.org) as our template engine
