# Special properties overview

With **Pochoir** you can use special properties to create powerful templates.

The main concept of **Pochoir** is to create template with less code as possible.

Special properties offers super powers to your template:

- Use [$.path](/special-properties/path) to rename a note
- Use [$.properties](/special-properties/properties) to merge properties between two templates
- Use [$.aliases](/special-properties/aliases) to select a template by its alias
- Use [$.imports](/special-properties/imports) to import variables and functions from other templates
