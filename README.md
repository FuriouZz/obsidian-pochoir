# Pochoir, an Obsidian Plugin

**Pochoir** is a template plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

## Status

This plugin is very experimental and I use it only for my use cases. If you are looking for a more mature alternative, I recommand [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater).

## Dependencies
- [ventojs](https://github.com/ventojs/vento)

## Why?

I wanted to create a plugin similar to [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) but with less scripting and has features out-of-the-box.

## Features

This plugin provides two approachs:
- Write template without code with special properties prefixed with `$.`
- Write complex template with javascript code block

## More information

For more complex templates, check the `./demo` vault.
