# Pochoir, an Obsidian Plugin

Pochoir is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin for note templating.

With simplicity in mind, we want note templating made easy, with few configurations and no coding experience.

## Status

This plugin is very experimental and I use it only for my use cases.

If you are looking for a more mature alternative, I recommand [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater).

## Getting Started

Follow the instruction on the [webpage](https://furiouzz.github.io/obsidian-pochoir/).

## Dependencies
- [ventojs](https://github.com/ventojs/vento)
- [valibot](https://valibot.dev/)

## More information

For more complex templates, check the `./demo` vault.
