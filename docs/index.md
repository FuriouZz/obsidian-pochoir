# Pochoir

Pochoir is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) enabling you to generate your note from a template.

From now, I invite you to:
- Follow the [installation](/installation) process to use the plugin in your vault
- Use powerful [properties](/special-properties) without coding skills
- Enhance your template generation with a [form](/form-code-block)
- [Trigger](/command-code-block) your template from command palette or ribbon actions
- Use [Javascript](/javascript-code-block) if you are an advanced users
- Read [vento.js](https://vento.js.org) documentation to improve your templates

## Why this plugin?

This plugin started from the frustration of not finding the right plugin for me or spending more time writing code with [Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/introduction.html) instead of creating template and start note-taking.

I liked the simplicity of the core **Template plugin**:
- No coding skill required
- Properties are merged automatically
- Place variables wherever you want

But it is too limited.

With **Pochoir**, I want to offer an easy and powerful user experience in template creation with small **yaml** and **javascript** code blocks.

I took the inspiration of using code block from 
[Silverbullet's space-lua](https://silverbullet.md/Space%20Lua) code block to configure SilverBullet.

With **yaml** code block, you can:
- Rename your note
- Generate a form
- Trigger your template from command palette or ribbon action
- Trigger a template by its aliases
- Merge properties from multiple templates
- Combine multiple templates

With **javascript** code block, you can:
- Extend the template engine with custom variables and functions
- Share variables and functions between templates
- Do everything above, programmatically
