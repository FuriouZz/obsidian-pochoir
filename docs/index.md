# Pochoir

Pochoir is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin for note templating.

With simplicity in mind, we designed it with minimal configuration and no coding experience.

Most plugin features are provided by some [special properties](/special-properties/overview).

**Features:**

- Use the [poichoir-properties](/props/overview) code block as an alternative to frontmatter.
- Use powerful [properties](/special-properties/overview) for file renaming, property merging, function imports, template aliases and more.
- Enhance your template generation with a [modal form](/form/overview).
- [Trigger](/command/overview) your template from the command palette or ribbon actions.
- Use [JavaScript](/javascript/overview) for more advanced usage.
- It is powered by [vento.js](https://vento.js.org) as our template engine.

Follow the [installation](/overview/installation) process to use the plugin in your vault.
